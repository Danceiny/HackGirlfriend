知乎 虽然没花钱 但是绝对是知乎
虽然时间不久 但是每次看到都会回想起那段话
if you are, you breathe.
If you breath, you talk.
If you talk, you ask.
If you ask, you think.
If you think, you search.
If you search, you experience.
If you experience, you learn.
If you learn, you grow.
If you grow, you wish.
If you wish, you find, and if you find, you doubt.
If you doubt, you question.
If you question, you understand, and if you understand, you know.
If you know, you want to know more.
If you want to know more, you are alive.
